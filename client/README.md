# ClaimBoard API Client

A simple Express.js backend for interacting with the ClaimBoard smart contract. This allows users to post claims, verify payments, and manage bounties through a REST API.

## Features

- **Post Claims**: Create new claims with bounties for payment verification
- **Verify Payments**: Resolve claims when payments are verified
- **Verify Non-Existence**: Resolve claims when payments are confirmed to not exist
- **Cancel Claims**: Allow posters to cancel claims and get refunds

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy environment file and configure:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

3. Update `.env` with your values:
```bash
RPC_URL=https://coston2-api.flare.network/ext/C/rpc
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # Your deployed ClaimBoard contract address
```

4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
# or for development
npm run dev
```

## Security Notes

- **Never expose private keys** in production
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Consider implementing proper authentication for production use
- Private keys are only needed for transaction signing

## Contract Integration

- Escrows bounties in ETH
- Manages claim lifecycle (Open â†’ Resolved/Cancelled)
- Handles bounty distribution to winners
- Provides refunds for cancelled claims
